/**
 * Admin Email Whitelist
 * ---------------------
 *
 * Users with these verified email addresses get admin privileges.
 * This is the easiest way to set up your first admin account.
 *
 * How to use:
 * 1. Add your email address to the array below
 * 2. Deploy with `npx convex deploy` or let `npx convex dev` sync
 * 3. Sign in with that email verified by your authentication provider.
 *
 * This is the recommended approach — it's simple, safe, and doesn't
 * expose a public mutation for role changes.
 *
 * @example
 * ```ts
 * export const ADMIN_EMAILS: string[] = [
 *   "admin@yourcompany.com",
 *   "developer@yourcompany.com",
 * ]
 * ```
