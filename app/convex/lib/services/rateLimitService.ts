/**
 * Rate Limit Service
 * ===================
 *
 * Uses the @convex-dev/rate-limiter component for persistent, distributed
 * rate limiting across all Convex function invocations.
 *
 * The in-memory approach (Map) is broken for Convex because state doesn't
 * persist across function invocations. This component stores rate limit
 * state in the Convex database.
 *
 * Usage:
 * ```typescript
 * import { rateLimiter } from './lib/services/rateLimitService'
 *
 * export const sendMessage = mutation({
 *   handler: async (ctx, args) => {
 *     const user = await requireAuth(ctx)
 *     await rateLimiter.limit(ctx, 'sendMessage', { key: user._id })
 *     // Continue with mutation logic
 *   }
 * })
 * ```

/**
 * Rate limiter instance with predefined limits per operation.

 * Uses token bucket algorithm:
 * - `rate`: tokens added per `period`
 * - `capacity`: max burst size
 * - `period`: refill window in ms

 */

 * Predefined rate limit configurations.
